## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
<br>
<br>
For this project, I set up a basic HTML page to view my progress during the javascript writing process. My  main focus for this project was to test my javascript skills. I spent a lot of time figuring out just how to get my ball to work, have the bars appear and have varying openings for the ball to go through. Once I was satisfied with the game dynamics, I shifted my focus to css to make the webpage more fun to look at. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about how dynamic and powerful JavaScript can be. It was extremely challenging to make sure all the bases were covered to make sure the game worked properly along with learning new aspects such as time intervals.
